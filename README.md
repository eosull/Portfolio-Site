# About 
This is my website displaying all of my development work. It is built using Django with Python, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

There is a landing page with personal info, a cv page with my professional/academic experience, a portfolio page with projects I have built and a contact page for people who want to get in touch.

As you'll see, the majority of the projects on it at the moment are ones I've complated during my studies at Code Institute but I will be adding more as I complete them!

# Agile 
I studied Agile methods during my studies and found it to be a useful way to structure development work. I maintained that during the building of this site.

The details of this can be seen on the GitHub project board [here](https://github.com/users/eosull/projects/6)
